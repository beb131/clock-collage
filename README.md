A collection of clocks created from scratch with React.

Currently only have Digital and Binary clocks, but I plan on adding an analog clock and many customizable options.

Technologies Used:

ReactJS

Things I learned:

- Many methods of the JS Date prototype that I previously did not know about.
- Gained a deeper understanding of Binary clocks.
- Learned how to use CSS box shadow to make an "LED"
