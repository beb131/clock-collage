A collection of clocks created from scratch with ReactJS (currently in progress).

Currently only have Digital and Binary clocks, but I plan on adding an analog clock and many customizable options.

<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>

- ReactJS

<strong>Things I learned:</strong>

- Many methods of the JS Date prototype that I previously did not know about.
- Gained a deeper understanding of Binary clocks.
- Learned how to use CSS box shadow to make an "LED"
